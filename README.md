# Designed for:

-   There was no regular time: every session was scheduled by the players on the fly
-   There was no regular party: each game had different players drawn from a pool of around 10-14 people.
-   There was no regular plot: The players decided where to go and what to do. It was a sandbox game in the sense that’s now used to describe video games like Grand Theft Auto, minus the missions. There was no mysterious old man sending them on quests. No overarching plot, just an overarching environment.
    
    The players created the deadlines from their interest in different areas. This forced the DM to do the work on the specific quest vs holding off till all the content for the campaign was prepared.


<a id="org1bbd63e"></a>

# Basics

-   The players have a home town where they we&rsquo;re all living together. This is where they trade info, plan their next foray, and rest up before the next adventure.
-   There is a detailed map showing the regions around the town. Each region comes with it&rsquo;s own tone, ecology and hazards. There are dungeons ruins and caves all over the place, big and small. Some places well known, some rumors, and some discoverable through exploring.
-   Players could choose anywhere that they want to go. (just not back east as that&rsquo;s inhabited and boring. They could go anywhere but learn that some places are a little too dangerous to start out in.


<a id="org9990c6e"></a>

# Scheduling

-   Players initiate adventure
-   They send an email to the whole group with basic a schedule for the event and wwhat they want to do in the game. Any who can or want to join the adventure can do so. Kind of like if they were in the tavern talking about their next adventure!

-   The GM has to be available that day (obviously) so this system only works if the GM is pretty flexible.

-   The players have to tell the GM where they plan on going well in advance, so he (meaning me) has at least a chance to prepare anything that’s missing. As the campaign goes on this becomes less and less of a problem, because so many areas are so fleshed out the PCs can go just about anywhere on the map and hit adventure. The GM can also veto a plan that sounds completely boring and not worth a game session.

-   All other decisions are up to the players — they fight it out among themselves, sometimes literally.

# Sharing info

-   players are strongly encouraged to share the info they learned from an adventure
-   Every player goes on a unique set of adventures. They will have a unique experience compared to other players.
-   each player will miss 2/3 of the game.
-   There were two main ways information got shared: `game summaries and the shared map`.
    -   Game summaries turned into tributes to the adventure that was had in the session
    -   Shared through email
    -   A shared map was filled in after each adventure with a section that was recently explored. More and more of the map would be filled in with detail added.
-   Shared information took a lot of burden off the DM to tell the story. The players built the story as they found clues and built connections

# Recycling

### Evolving Dungeons

-   tons of detail could be added to specific regions because players would be returning there
-   Lots of players meant new players would visit already visited regions. ROI
-   Dungeons could evolve. Wipe some creatures out and who knows what could set up shop


<a id="org837588f"></a>

### Wandering Monsters

-   Each region had a wandering monster table that would help define what the region would look like
-   players never saw these wandering monster tables put could piece meal the lists together given the adventures that they had in each region


<a id="orgdc60aad"></a>

# Death & Danger


<a id="org197322b"></a>

## Danger Gradients: Paths of Exploration

-   West Marches was intended to be a campaign environment
-   Each region would have an encounter level to gauge the threats of the region
-   The farther out you got, the more dangers the areas
-   Terrain (mountains, rivers, valleys etc.) created &rsquo;paths of exploration&rsquo;
-   Each region held tidbits of further regions
-   Multiple paths allowed players to explore further and further into one path die, start over and explore another path with a consistent gameplay starting back at lower levels.


<a id="org7dc042b"></a>

## Danger Pockets: Barrow Mounds & Treasure Rooms

-   These pockets were either easy to find and well known or hard to find and completely unkown. either way you had to be looking for them.
-   Every dungeon was a permanent feature.
-   Dungeons would have treasure rooms that we harder. Well hidden or hard to crack with a higher encounter level.

# Run your own game


<a id="org7d7e1c8"></a>

## Building it

-   Make town safe and the wilds wild
-   keep NPC adventurers rare. NPC&rsquo;s make everything harder in this setting
-   Build dungeons with treasure rooms, locked rooms, pockets of danger.


<a id="orgcca699a"></a>

## Running it

-   Appear passive. The sandbox nature of the game demands you remain neutral about what the players do.
-   Provide an easy lead to get new players started. &rsquo;dwarven treasure beyond bearing&rsquo;
-   the adventure is in the wilderness, not the town
-   let the players take over. Let them write game summaries, don&rsquo;t clean up the shared map.
-   competition is what it&rsquo;s all about. Fair reqards, scarcity, bragging rights.
-   require scheduling on the mailing list
-   fear the social monster. West marches is a swirling vortex of ambition and insecurity

# Youtube summary

-   The problem with normal D&D and having game night: players show up each week and become a little less interested in the world around them. They become more passive and the DM has to do more work to move the story along.
-   West marches: there is no game night.
-   Create a forum for the players.
-   Good for a larger group. 30-40 players.
-   Group is determined by the players. What plot threads and rumors do players want to run and who do they want to go with.
-   You could have multiple DMs
-   The treasure map doesn&rsquo;t have to be to scale or strictly accurate.
-   You wait for the players to tell you what they are doing and then go create the content for that area/dungion/adventure
-   This is kind of like an MMO
-   You can seed rumors to different players based on class or background. Player A should have rumors that are interesting to Player B.
-   The DM shouldn&rsquo;t get involved in creating and maintaining the map. The map is built by the players and isn&rsquo;t completely accurate.
-   Each player does their own write up of their adventure. Inspiration points for this.
-   Might have to come up with arbitrary rules because of the social competitive aspects of the game.
-   You could have 5 tokens given to each adventuring group that are given to the best player&rsquo;s write up of that adventure. Voted on by the group. These tokens could be traded amongst players and used for as inspiration
-   Swirling vortex of ambition and insecurity
-   It&rsquo;s competitive because groups want to conquer areas for the first time
-   Players will naturally leave threads behind.
-   Sharing of information: A 6th level group won&rsquo;t want to go back to a 3rd level area but a 3rd level group will hear about it and want to explore that area.
-   players vs the world.
